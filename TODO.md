# TipTap Pagination Plus - Technical Improvements TODO

Based on comprehensive code review feedback, prioritized by impact and effort.

## ðŸ”´ High Priority - Bug Fixes (Do Soon)

### Scroll Position During Line Wrap
- [x] **Typing causes scroll jump when line wraps** - Fixed! Cursor position now maintained in viewport
  
  **Solution Implemented**:
  - Detect when typing (not Enter key) causes content changes
  - Save cursor position relative to viewport before repagination
  - Block automatic `scrollIntoView` during typing operations
  - Restore cursor to same viewport position after repagination
  - Special handling to allow Enter key at end of document to work normally

## ~~ðŸ”´ High Priority - Bug Fixes (Do Soon)~~ COMPLETED

### Scroll Glitch on Backspace
- [x] **Backspace scroll glitch at end of document** - Fixed! Scroll position now preserved during page reduction
  
  **Solution Implemented**:
  - Save scroll offset from bottom when deletion is detected
  - Block automatic `scrollIntoView` during deletion operations
  - Restore scroll position after page count reduction based on saved offset
  - Clean up protection flags after successful restoration
  
  **Investigation Summary**:
  - **Scenario**: Go to end of doc, press Enter to create new page, then press Backspace during repagination
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple interacting factors:
    1. When backspace causes page reduction (e.g., 6â†’5 pages), container height shrinks
    2. Browser automatically clamps scroll to new maximum (e.g., 3896.5 â†’ 3147)
    3. The glitch only happens when cursor is in lines 1-5 of the viewport (not lines 6+)
    4. `scrollIntoView` is called multiple times during repagination, fighting with scroll position
  
  **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. âœ— Saving scroll position earlier in transaction - scroll already reset by then
  2. âœ— Native keydown capture - captured correct scroll but still glitched
  3. âœ— Continuous scroll enforcement with RAF - detected reset but couldn't prevent it
  4. âœ— Setting overflow:hidden during pagination - didn't prevent the reset
  5. âœ— Deferring height reduction until after scroll unlock - complex interaction with scrollIntoView
  6. âœ— Viewport-based detection (top 5 lines) - detection worked but prevention failed
  7. âœ“ **Save offset from bottom + block scrollIntoView** - Successful approach!

### Memory Leaks & Stability
- [x] **Add destroyed flag** - Prevent async operations after extension destroy
  ```ts
  // Track destroyed state and guard async operations
  if (this.destroyed) return;
  ```
- [x] **Reset `allowUnstableUpdate` flag** - Clear flag on any decoration refresh to prevent ghost gaps
  ```ts
  if (extensionStorage.allowUnstableUpdate) {
    extensionStorage.allowUnstableUpdate = false;
  }
  ```
- [x] **Clear ResizeObserver timeout** - Ensure timeout is cleared if extension destroyed before it fires
- [x] **Guard Promise chains** - Add early returns in `measureAndUpdatePages` async body

### Edge Cases
- [x] **Cursor position clamping** - Already fixed with `Math.min(savedCursorPos, this.editor.state.doc.content.size)`
- [x] **Large delete ghost gaps** - Fix `allowUnstableUpdate` not being reset properly

### Type Safety
- [x] **Add missing storage type** - Declare `remeasureContent` in `addStorage()` return type
  ```ts
  remeasureContent: (delay?: number) => void;
  ```

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority - Performance Wins

### Layout Thrashing Fix (High Impact, Low Effort)
- [ ] **Single wrapper visibility toggle** - Replace individual element hiding with single wrapper
  ```ts
  // Instead of hiding hundreds of elements individually
  const paginationWrapper = targetNode.querySelector('#pages') as HTMLElement;
  paginationWrapper.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  const naturalHeight = targetNode.scrollHeight;
  paginationWrapper.style.visibility = '';
  ```
  **Impact**: Eliminates hundreds of reflows, significant performance improvement
  **Note**: Experimented with height auto approach but caused copy/paste regressions

### Throttling Improvements
- [x] **Throttle ResizeObserver with RAF**
  ```ts
  const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver(entries => {
    if (this._resizeFrame) cancelAnimationFrame(this._resizeFrame);
    this._resizeFrame = requestAnimationFrame(() => remeasureContent(50));
  });
  ```
- [x] **Use `requestIdleCallback`** - Replace chained `setTimeout` for image/font waits with `requestIdleCallback` (16ms timeout)

### Minor Optimizations
- [x] **Return typed plugin key**
  ```ts
  const PAGINATION_PLUGIN = new PluginKey<DecorationSet>('pagination');
  ```

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority - Code Quality

### Code Organization (When Time Allows)
- [ ] **Split into 4 files** for better maintainability:
  1. `pagination-dom.ts` - DOM creation/manipulation for breaks, headers, footers
  2. `measurement.ts` - Height calculations + waitForXXX helpers  
  3. `state.ts` - Storage definition + helpers
  4. `extension.ts` - Main extension glue code

### Code Style
- [ ] **Early-exit guards** - Refactor nested `if`s in `measureAndUpdatePages` to early returns
- [x] **Named constants** - Replace magic numbers (48, 20, 5) with named constants
- [ ] **Simplify conditional logic** - Reduce 300-line nested conditionals

### CSS Improvements
- [ ] **Static stylesheet** - Ship CSS as static file instead of injected strings
- [ ] **CSS-in-JS with typing** - If keeping dynamic CSS, add proper typing
- [ ] **Tree-shaking support** - Ensure CSS rules can be tree-shaken

### Configuration Architecture
- [ ] **Configurable padding/typography** - Make contentPadding, fontSize, lineHeight configurable without breaking height calculations
  - Currently hardcoded to 48px padding and 24px line-height for stable pagination
  - Height calculation algorithm needs to properly account for configurable values
  - Should allow developers to customize editor appearance while maintaining accurate page breaks

## ðŸ”µ Future Considerations (Major Changes)

### Alternative Architecture (Only if Performance Issues)
- [ ] **CSS Columns Approach** - Prototype using CSS columns + `break-after: page` for printing
  - Keep editor single-scroll for editing
  - Paginate only for export/print via off-DOM iframe
  - Let browser handle page breaks natively
  - **Pros**: Eliminates runtime measurement complexity
  - **Cons**: Complete rewrite, may lose current edge case handling

### API Improvements
- [ ] **Single Responsibility** - Consider splitting into separate extensions:
  - Pagination logic
  - Layout measurement  
  - Cursor/scroll restoration
- [ ] **Expose fewer internals** - Simplify public API surface

## âœ… Recently Completed

## Notes

- **Current Status**: Extension works well and handles complex edge cases
- **Performance**: Generally good, but layout thrashing fix would provide significant improvement
- **Stability**: High priority fixes address real memory leak and edge case bugs
- **Maintainability**: Code organization improvements can wait until needed

**Philosophy**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Focus on high-impact, low-effort improvements first.
